Create a python script that uses ChatGTP4 API to produce images based on prompts. 

Here is how that script works:

# file naming and handling

- opens the file "input.txt"
- summarise the input in 3-4 words
- creates an output filename which consists of the date (yyyymmdd) plus a 24h timestamp with hours, minutes and seconds, a dash and than the 3-4 word summary of the input.

# prompt assembly and archiving

- assemble the prompt:
- open "pre-prompt.txt" for the beginning of the prompt
- add the prompt from "input.txt"
- open "post-prompt.txt" for the end of the prompt
- save the prompt under the filename plus ".txt"

# API calling

- call the ChatGTP 4 API to create n images (constant nofimages, set at the beginning of the script) on the basis of the prompt
- save each of the image with name consisting of above filename, a dash and a two digit number corresponding of the n-th image
- add code that checks for api throttling and adding a wait loop that tries again after a 2min wait
